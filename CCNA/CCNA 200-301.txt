Components
------------

1) Routers
Router makes packet forwarding decisinos based on IP addresses
    - Maintains a routing table, which decides on where to send packets
    - Based on the netowkr a packet needs to get to, the router sends it out of an interface
    - Router knows where to send based on, static configuration, already connected to 
    said network, or a routing protocol that educates our router about where a network resides 
    - Theres a default route, which is a router doesn't have enough info, it just sends it out on that interface
    - Basically just a packet forwarder

2) Ethernet switches 
    - Makes frame forwarding decision basked on destination MAC addresses 
    - Not IP addresses, but MAC addresses 
    - MAC address = Media Access Control address, a 48 bit address burned into the hardware by manufactoure
    - The switch looks at the frames of the packets, and then learns from the ports where each mac address is 
    - From this, it then constructs each MAC address table and intelligently forwards subsequent frames from those learned MAC addresses
    - When a new pakcet comes into contact, the switch copies it, then floods it through the network, pings all devices on all interfaces
    to see which one it belongs to and then keeps a record in the MAC address table of the corret destination
    - The correct device will return trafic, and then an entry is made in the MAC address table, no more flooding

3) Security Applicances
    IPS: Intrusion Prevention System
    -> Sits between inline with traffic and checks that traffic against a database of known threats 
    -> Drops packets if it is a recorded threat 
    Next Generation Firewall : Application Firewall
    -> Deep packet inspection
    -> Intrusion Prevention System
    -> Encrypted traffic inspection
        -> Does a really goof job at spotting encrypted traffic which can pass through the IPS (99% successrate)
    -> This is one step beyond a stateful Firewall
        -> Stateful firewall allows all traffic if it origintes from same network 
    -> RTP protocol follows SIP protocol 
    -> Layer 7 inspection allows you to see where traffic is going, and then can get analytics from it
        -> "15% of our traffic is to social media sites" 

4) Components 
    -ADhoc Wireless Lan: Two laptops communicating between radio waves (limited, can't really scale)
        -> move too far, and the radiowaves can't be understood
        -> Can't do large transfers of files too easily
    -Infrastructure Wireless LAN: Sort of thing you'd have in your home (a wireless router)
        -> its given a name (Service Set Identifier)
        -> BasicServiceSetIdentifier: Mac address of single access wireless access point
    -Mesh Wireless LAN: A collection, not a single acces point
    -Enterprise Wireless LAN: 
        -> Wireless LAN contoller, and an Ethernet switch connected to wireless accesspoints

5) Endpoints and Servers 
    - Endpoint is known as a client
    - Client - Server architecture
    - Peer to Peer architecture
        -> The clinets themselves are serving up resources 
        -> Not as robust, the clinent might not have the best servers installed to handle traffic appropriately 

6) Cisco DNA Center 
    - Manages network through a graphical and programming interface 
    - It allows:
        1) Design of a network 
        2) Can assign and apply policy through it
        3) Can assing quiality of Service (assigning bandwidth)
        4) Provisioning as well 
        5) Has a path trace tool (ping, or tailnet section)
            -> Gives a graphical representaiton of a netowrk 
        6) Can give a history or what is going on in the network 

6) Virtulising Devices 
    - In the old days, if you want a server, like a linux one, and windows one, an oracle one, it needs it's own OS
        -> Expensive to have all these resources, lots wasted etc
    - Instead, you can consolidate these resources onto a virtulised server, which can run linux, microsoft, oracle 
    - This virtual server, will have lots of resources and at least one ethernet card which connects it to the world
    - It runs a hypervisor, which is software which allows it to craete, start, and stop virtual machines 
        - Type 1: native hypervisor, runs directly on the server hardware 
        - Type 2: Hosted hypervisor, runs in a tradional operating system (might run through mac computer or somehign)
    - Virtulisation: 
        Virtual NetworkInterfaceCard: Software associated with a unique MAC address used by a VM to send and receive packets 
        A VNIC gets plugged into a virtual switch 
        Can also run virtual firewalls, virtual load balancers 
    - Virtulisation is all about consolidatin gresources on a single machine, and then running a hypervisor to set which machine is being used

7) TCP vs UPD 
    
    - TCP 3 way handshake: (connection oreinetated protocol) 
        1) a machine sends a SYN (synchronisation) message to a machine it wants to talk to
        2) if the other machine wants to talk, it sends a syn-ack back 
        3) first machine then sends an ack back to finish the threeway handshake
    - UDP (connectionless protocol, no handshake ) <- doesn't etablish a session
        1) No evidence data arrives, fire and forget protocol 
    
    Both protocols travel through IP packets
    IP packets have source and destination addresses , and eithe rUDP or TCP payload
    Well known port for HTTP traffic is 80 

    - Well known ports 
        FTP: 20/21
        SSH: 22
        DNS: 43
        HTTP: 80
        HTTPS: 443
