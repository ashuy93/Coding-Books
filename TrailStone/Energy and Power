Oil and Gas industry is divided into three sectors

    Upstream:
        - Searchnig for potential oil and gas sources, drilling wells
        - Hisorically, these see the most M&A deals 
    Midstream:
        - Transportation (pipeline, rail, barge, oil tanker)
        - Storage
        - Marketing
        - Moving oil from source to refineries 
    Downstream:
        - Refining the product
            this can be into 
            1) Petrol 
            2) Kerosene
            3) Jet fuel
            4) Diesel
        - Dealing with biproducfts, such as sulphur

Diesel & petrol both made from mineral oil, but the refining methods are different
    - diesel produces more energe when combusted
    - Crude oil is a mix of hydrocarbons, some longer than others, giving different boiling points
    - Petrol has less hydrocarbon length chain
