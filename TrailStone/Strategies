    -> This is relyed upon in emotional situations
    -> Also stuck to, so it can be reviewed and enhanced

Strategies generally rely on the deployment 
of technical analysis, which tracks price movements
such as moving averages 

Strategies can be used in conjunction of other strategies

----------------------------
Range Trading
---------------------------- 
- Built around Bolinger Bands
    -> Type of statistical charting, volatility of an instrument over time
- Range trading, buying at support leve, and then selling at the resistance
    level, when the prices are at the top of the range
- Bottoms and tops are heavily influenced by the trading supply and demand
- Once the high maxes out, traders usually anticipate the fall

----------------------------
Breakout Trading
----------------------------
- Seeks to capatalise on short term movements
- When a trader buys just as the level hits its support,
    or sells, when the level is just about to his its resistance level
- Can be used in conjunction with range trading if support and resistance levels are known
- Philosophy, a market cannot continue its trend, without new highs or lows
    this strategy works best, when trends are strong and long lastin
- Performs poorly when the market is not able to establish strong trends

- A breakout occurs when the price moves above resistance level, or below support level
- Breakouts are subjective, as not all traders have the same resistance and support levels

-Traders who initalise breakouts, often use Stop-Loss Orders, incase the breakout fails
    - StopLoss Order: 
        -> Buy shares in microsoft at $20
        -> StopLoss Order could be put in at $18, whereby
            -> All shares are sold at the current market price
            -> If the price drops below $18 
        - Pros:
            -> Don't have to constatnly watch share price
        - Negatives: 
            -> Market fluctuations could activte the stop price
            -> Have to be aware of the trend, factor in a sensible percentage swing
            -> Setting a 5% stop loss on a stock that has a history of fluctuating 10%
                is not sensible, will probably lose money on the commission
        - Once you reach the stop price, your StopLoss order becomes a market order
            and the sell price could be quite different to the stop price
            - This is especially true for fast moving markets
        - They're also used to lock in profits

    Analystical Pricing
        - Uses black scholaes

    Discounted Cash Flow just doesnt work
