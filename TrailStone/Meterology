Have strong fundamentals
    -> Physics & Chemistry HL IB A* equivilent

The US Dollar has a huge inverse impact on crude oil prices

How weather affects oil prices:
    Oil&Gas
        -> Seasonal,
             we use more in winter
        -> Natural Disasters 
            -> this impacts delivery
    - Weather matters a great deal, as it boils down to supply and Demand
        -> but given its a chaotic system, its hard to accurately predict
            -> Especilly for more than a couple of days 
        -> Other things can be deducted from it
            -> for instance, high winds, impling ships can't perform maintenance on turbines
                -> Have to turn off those turbines
    Crops
        -> Early snow can affect yields     
            -> Especailly corn, coffee, sugar 
            -> Early snow can drive gad prices higher, which makes it harder to collect these
                prices
        -> Heavy rainfall can increase crop yield 

Current Events:
    **Discuss Supply and Demand dynamics**
    Oil&Gas
        -> Say an oil pipeline explodes in the US 
            1) Meant to be delivering oil to the east coast
            2) On one hand, supply decreases on the east coast, so prices rises
            3) On the other hand, you were supposed to be
                delivering to another client in a diff region
            4) Do you want to lose the relationship, over a short term gain?
            5) So mathematically, you might have the equations
                explosion = supply increase = price increase
                -> But is this necessarily true? 

Questions I'm interested in....

    Extrapolating to Locations:
        I have the temperate close to tennis stadiums
            -> I get this from Airports etc 
        
    Intuition from my knowledge:
        Does Air have weight? 
            -> If youre in mountains, can't cook with boiling Water
                -> Air has weight, due to this pressure 

        Temperatue of Air has determines its weight/density
            -> Air rises

        How much water vapour is contained within the Air
            -> Trying to predict humidity 
            -> Absolute humidity, and relative percentage
    
Have experience with the Bloomberg terminal
    -> For instance using it to try and correlate negative news articles 
        with increases in temperature
